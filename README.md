# streamlit-shap

`streamlit-shap` is a Streamlit component that provides a wrapper to display [SHAP](https://github.com/slundberg/shap) plots in [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/). `streamlit-shap` is developed by our in-house staff Snehan Kekre [[1]](https://github.com/snehankekre/streamlit-shap) who also maintains the Streamlit Documentation website.

Firstly, install Streamlit (of course!) then pip install the `streamlit-shap` library:
```bash
pip install streamlit
pip install streamlit-shap
```

There are also other prerequisite libraries to install if you haven't yet done so:
```bash
pip install matplotlib
pip install scikit-learn
```


## Demo app

## Code
Here's how to use `st.write`:
```python
import streamlit as st


```

## Line-by-line explanation
The very first thing to do when creating a Streamlit app is to start by importing the `streamlit` library as `st` like so:
```python
import streamlit as st
```
